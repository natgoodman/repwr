Title: Replication Power
Version: 1.00
Authors@R: person("Nathan", "Goodman", email = "natg@shore.net", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A collection of R scripts and documents exploring the power of replication to detect bad science. Treat replication as a statistical test, simulates proposed replication methods across a wide range of conditions, and estimates error rates for conditions of interest. The main point is that replication is a poor statistical test with unacceptable error rates under most conditions. It works as a validation test only when the original and replica studies are sampling nearly identical populations. Methods for testing whether the populations are similar work poorly under all conditions analyzed.
